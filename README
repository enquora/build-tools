A few major changes to Garcon

Design

the build tools first build a url system in which everything for every app is managed under the apps url,
which equals the name. From there the app can be served.

Saving will have to transform the urls.

Handlers => singletons, take configuration from files that are given



CHANGES 

There are a lot of changes regarding Garcon.

- caching is organized as part of a file itself
- contentType is organized as of a file itself
- frameworks don't register files in the server, the server will detect an url conforms to
  a specific framework, then will ask this framework whether it has a file like the url given.
  The framework then decides what to give back, either a file or a combined file automatically (!)
